# COMP1000: Introduction to Computer Programming

**Overview**

In this unit, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer science, which provided me with a practical understanding of basic computing and programming. I gained hands-on experience in computer programming and implemented problem solutions described in informal prose using an imperative language.

I learned how to design, code, test, and debug simple algorithms, gaining practical experience in each of these areas. I also understood the principle of incremental development.

I delved into the concept of program correctness and explored the differences between high-level languages, assembly languages, and machine languages. I learned about the crucial role that compilers play and how programs are executed by computer hardware. This unit served as a comprehensive introduction to the world of computer science.

**Technology Used**

The practical work in this unit involved programming in the Processing language (http://processing.org), which has given me experience with features that are used in many modern programming languages.

**Programming Assessment**

Throughout the semester, I was tasked with two programming assignments. The first was due in week 7, and the second was to be submitted by the end of week 12. The Programming Assessment challenged me to apply all my skills to create a simple game. Upon successful completion, I gained several skills. I learned to apply problem-solving techniques to develop algorithms for small to medium-sized computational problems. I also learned to design and write code to implement a program description in an imperative programming language. I became proficient in using standard software engineering practices to document, debug, and test my programs. I understood and applied concepts of variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and compound data in the implementation of programmed systems. Lastly, I learned to identify and describe ethical issues in an academic environment and demonstrated active engagement in the learning process. This experience was a comprehensive exercise in applying and expanding my programming skills.
