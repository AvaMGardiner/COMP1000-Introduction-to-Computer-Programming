# COMP1000: Introduction to Computer Programming

**Overview**

In this unit, I was introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer science, which provided me with a practical understanding of basic computing and programming. I gained hands-on experience in computer programming and implemented problem solutions described in informal prose using an imperative language.

I learned how to design, code, test, and debug simple algorithms, gaining practical experience in each of these areas. I also understood the principle of incremental development.

I delved into the concept of program correctness and explored the differences between high-level languages, assembly languages, and machine languages. I learned about the crucial role that compilers play and how programs are executed by computer hardware. This unit served as a comprehensive introduction to the world of computer science.

**Technology Used**

The practical work in this unit involved programming in the Processing language (http://processing.org), which has given me experience with features that are used in many modern programming languages.

**Programming Assessments**

Throughout the semester, I was assigned two programming assignments. These tasks required me to apply all the skills I had acquired from the lectures and tutorials to develop a simple game.
